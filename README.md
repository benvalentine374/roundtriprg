repo for the file contents of the roundtriprg.com website

todo:
-figure out how to forward cloudflare pages domain to our domain
e.g. `roundtrip.pages.dev/*` -> `roundtriprg.com/*`, but instead they are separate websites...

-figure out how to format pictures
e.g. canva, tinypng
need a way to make transparent images

-weird website behavior
maybe javascript
e.g. `https://roundtriprg.com/#` after pressing purchase now button, 
`https://roundtriprg.com/#[object%20Object]` after pressing 'MEN'

-figure out how to run website on localhost
nginx, node.js

-user authentication features? like logging in/signing up
old personal server project - pserv
private folder?

-what about the pay.roundtriprg.com subdomain?
currently under godaddy
is there a way to change that?

-video support? HTML5 fallback? directory traversal attack prevention?

-svelte,django

-performance? raspberry pi for another website?
