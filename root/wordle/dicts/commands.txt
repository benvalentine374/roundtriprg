If the wordlists are dict1.txt and dict2.txt, use:
sort -u dict1.txt dict2.txt > merged.txt
This:
-Merges the files.
-Sorts the result.
-Removes duplicates.

Most Linux/macOS systems have a word list at /usr/share/dict/words. You can filter 6-letter words like this:
grep -E '^[a-zA-Z]{6}$' /usr/share/dict/words > six_letter_words.txt
This selects words with exactly 6 letters (both uppercase and lowercase).
